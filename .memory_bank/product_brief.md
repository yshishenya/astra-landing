## Project Goal (WHY)

Build the first AI-powered career counseling assistant for **internal** career development in Russia.

**Solution:**
Astra analyzes employee resumes using AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) and generates personalized career development recommendations **within the company** in 90 seconds instead of 2-3 hours.

**Business Impact:**
- **162x ROI** in the first year
- **Payback period:** 2-3 days
- **Churn reduction:** 5-10%
- **Savings:** 6-20M RUB/year (depending on company size)
