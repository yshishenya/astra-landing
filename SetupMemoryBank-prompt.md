Work in hierarchical parallel subtasks (using Task tool) to avoid the context to grow fast.\
To start tasks in parallel, use multiple Task tools in one message.\
Extensively plan ahead by using todos (TodoWrite tool), as the process is very cumbersome and sophisticated, and you need to be very organized to succeed.\
Use todos (TodoWrite tool) even in subtasks of the deeper level, to that would save on the context even more.\
In general, this should look like:\
  - Run top-level task ROOT\
    - Do subtask A\
      - Do sub-sub-task A/X\
      - Do sub-sub-task A/Y\
    - Do subtask B\
      - Do sub-sub-task B/X\
      - Do sub-sub-task B/Y\
        - Do sub-sub-sub-task B/Y/M\
        - Do sub-sub-sub-task B/Y/N\
      - Do sub-sub-task B/Z\
