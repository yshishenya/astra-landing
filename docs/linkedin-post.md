## Extended Version (Optional)

**Systematic AI-Assisted Development: A Template Approach**

Working with AI coding assistants often leads to context loss after extended sessions and inconsistent code patterns across features. We've addressed this with an open-source template implementing the AI SWE methodology.

**What it provides:**
- Memory Bank: Persistent project knowledge and architectural decisions
- Custom workflows: Standardized processes for feature development, bug fixes, and code reviews
- Multi-language support: Ready-to-use templates for Python, JS/TS, Go, and Rust
- Quick setup: Operational in 2 minutes via GitHub template or one-liner

Based on methodology by Denis Kiselev (@Deksden): https://habr.com/ru/articles/934806/
