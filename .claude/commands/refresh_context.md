Context may have been lost or compressed. It is necessary to refresh memory. Execute the following steps:

1.  Re-read `.memory_bank/README.md` completely to understand the overall structure.
2.  Study the current tasks in `.memory_bank/current_tasks.md` to understand what we are working on.
3.  Review the latest code changes to stay informed about the current state.

After this, output the message "Context updated" and briefly describe the current project status and active task.
